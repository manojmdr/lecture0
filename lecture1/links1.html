                    Simple Case Expression.
    
                    Using Case expression you can achieve the IF-THEN-ELSE logic in Oracle SQL that too without invoking
                    any kind of SQL procedures. 
                    CASE expression can do all the work of a DECODE expression. Several books recommend using CASE over
                    DECODE because 
                    CASE expressions are easier to read in comparison to DECODE expression and
                    CASE expression is ANSI-compliant and forms part of the SQL/92 standard.
                    In Oracle there are two types of CASE expressions 
                    Simple case expressions
                    Searched case expressions
                    Simple Case Expression
                    As the name suggests it is the simplest version of CASE expression in other words we can say that it
                    is a flexible and easiest version of DECODE expression. 
                    The syntax of “Simple Case Expression” is 
                    CASE search_expression
                    WHEN   input_expression 1   THEN   output_result 1
                    WHEN   input_expression 2   THEN   output_result 2
                    …
                    WHEN   input_expression N   THEN   output_result N
                    ELSE    Else_result
                    END
                    Where
                    Search_Expression is the expression to be evaluated.
                    Input_Expressions are the expressions to be evaluated against search_expression.
                    Output_Results are the returned results (one for each possible expression). If expression1 evaluates
                    to search_expression, result1 is returned, and similarly for the other expressions.
                    Else_Result is returned when no matching expression is found.
                    The Simple Case Expression uses search expression to determine the return value. Means simple case
                    expression evaluates all the input expressions against the search expression. Once a match is found
                    the corresponding result is returned otherwise Else result is displayed. Furthermore the Else
                    statement is optional so in case you omit it then Null is displayed when the simple case expression
                    cannot find a match.
                    Points to remember
                    The data type of all the input expressions must match with the data type of search expression. Means
                    data type of search expression and input expression must be the same.
                    The datatype of all the output results must match with Else result means the data type of output
                    result along with else result must be the same.
                    The maximum number of arguments in a CASE expression is 255. All expressions count toward this
                    limit, including the initial expression of a simple CASE expression and the optional ELSE
                    expression. Each WHEN … THEN pair counts as two arguments. To avoid exceeding this limit, you can
                    nest CASE expressions so that the output_result itself is a CASE expression.
    
                    Query 1: Column Name as Search Expression.
                    SELECT first_name,department_id,
                    (CASE    department_id
                    WHEN    10    THEN    ‘Administration’
                    WHEN    20    THEN    ‘Marketing’
                    WHEN    30    THEN    ‘Purchasing’
                    WHEN    40    THEN    ‘Shipping’
                    WHEN    50    THEN    ‘Shipping’
                    ELSE    ‘Sorry’
                    END)    Departments
                    FROM    employees
                    WHERE    department_id    BETWEEN 10 AND 50
                    ORDER BY 2;
    
                    Let’s take a look at the case block of this query. We are using column department_id of employees
                    table as our search expression and the values from department id column (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50) are
                    serving as input expressions of WHEN-THEN pairs.
                    Whenever we specify a column name of a table as search expression the oracle engine treats all the
                    data from this column as an array and matches all the input_expressions with every element of this
                    array and if a match is found, it returns the corresponding result values, Otherwise the else
                    statement gets return.
                    Query 2: String as Search Expression.
                    In case you specify a string instead of a column name as a search expression then oracle will find
                    the first best fit match and then return the corresponding result value. 
    
                    SELECT
                    CASE ‘Dog’
                    WHEN    ‘Cat’    THEN    ‘1 Flase’
                    WHEN    ‘Dog’    THEN    ‘2 True’
                    WHEN    ‘Cow’    THEN    ‘3 False’
                    WHEN    ‘Dog’    THEN    ‘4 True’
                    ELSE    ‘Sorry’
                    END
                    FROM    dual;
    
                    Here in this simple case, the search expression is ‘Dog’ along with 4 When-and-Then pairs. The input
                    expression of 2nd and 4th pair is a string “Dog” which is a perfect match for our search expression
                    but on executing this query, oracle engine will return the result value from the first best match
                    which in our case is the 2nd pair.
                    So that is it guys on Case Expression. Hope it helped you. Kindly please share it on your social
                    network so that I can reach more people. Thanks & have a great day!
